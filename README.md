> TypeScript RabbitMQ Consumer Starter is a boilerplate for building RabbitMQ Consumer services using NodeJS and TypeScript.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Clear Structure** with different layers such as consumers, controllers, services, repositories, models, and so on.
- **Dependency Injection** done with the nice framework from [TypeDI](https://github.com/pleerock/typedi).
- **Simplified Database Query** with the ORM [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
- **Smart Validation** thanks to [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator).
- **Smart Transformation** thanks to [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer).
- **Smart Concurrent Processing** thanks to [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently).
- **Easy API Testing** with included unit testing thanks to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest).
- **Easy RabbitMQ Integration** thanks to [@amndns/amqp-ts](https://github.com/amndns/amqp-ts).

| **.env.example**                        | Example raw environment configurations |
| **app.ts**                              | Consumer server entrypoint - concurrently calls all of the consumer processes |
| **app-consumer.ts [FILENAME]**          | Single consumer entrypoint - the one being called by `app.ts` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notifications Webhook

The sample consumer provided is designed to be a simple webhook service that sends a sample HTTP POST request notification to https://reqres.in/api/users. The sample consumer and its resources are also designed to be fault-tolerant. The boilerplate declares a RabbitMQ exchange with a main queue and a dead-letter queue. 

| Queue                        | Exchange          | Routing Key                | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| **notifications.queue**      | **notifications** | **notifications.key**      | Example main queue - redirects the message to `notifications.dead.queue` when there's a failure |
| **notifications.dead.queue** | **notifications** | **notifications.dead.key** | Example dead-letter queue with TTL - redirects the message back to `notifications.queue` after TTL expiration |

## üöÄ Get Started

This project was created using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Before running any of the `yarn` commands below, make sure you create a `.env` file first. You can simply copy the contents of the `.env.example` into your local `.env` file. Moreover, make sure you also have the proper local resources running before starting the server (e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL).

Below is a guide on the common commands you might use all throughout the development process. In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

Installs all package dependencies of the app. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed and configured first.

#### `yarn start`

Starts the server by transpiling all of the `.ts` code to `.js` and then running the `dist/app.js` entrypoint.

#### `yarn start:watch`

Starts the server in watch mode by concurrently transpiling all of the `.ts` code to `.js` and running the `dist/app.js` entrypoint.

#### `yarn lint`

Launches the linter against all of the `.ts` files from the `src/` and `test/` directory. The project specifically uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the linter and code formatter, respectively.

#### `yarn test:unit`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode using Jest. The test is launched against all of the `.ts` files from the `test/` directory.

## üìë Logging

[Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) is being used as the logger. To log HTTP requests, we use the express middleware [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan). You can check a sample usage of the logger utility.

```typescript
import { Logger, WinstonLogger } from '@amndns/service-utils/logger';

@Service()
export class SampleService {
    constructor(
      @Logger(__filename) private log: WinstonLogger,
    ) {}

    ...
```
